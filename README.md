# notecat

A lightweight macos app, with a text-based note-taking interface for Obsidian

## what is notecat

notecat opens a simple text interface that you can access via Spotlight. It lets you quickly jot down thoughts, ideas, and links directly into your Obsidian vault without the overhead of launching the full Obsidian app.

## why did i need this

Sometimes I have fleeting ideas, links, or notes you'd like to capture instantly. While Slack personal chat is convenient, it isn’t integrated with my Obsidian "second brain". Opening Obsidian and navigating to the right folder interrupts my flow and dilutes the original thought.

## why I love it

**Instant access**: Launch via Spotlight (⌘+Space).

**Minimal UI**: A single text box optimized for quick entry.

**Seamless integration**: Saves notes as Markdown files in your specified Obsidian folder.

**Searchable**: Find your notes later using Obsidian’s search.

## installation

Clone and open in xcode + cmd R
